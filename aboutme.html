            <div class="bio">I am fourth-year undergraduate student at Northwestern Universiy studying Neuroscience with 
                a concentration in Human Behavior and Cognition and Computer Science at the Weinberg college of Arts and Sciences. 
                I work as a peer mentor and teaching assistant for an introductory Python course, helping to lead discussion sections and 
                grade homeworks, quizzes and projects. I've also worked in a Neurosciene lab at Northwestern that uses fMRI data to study neural 
                networks and how they affect human behavior. I intend to start my career as a Software Engineer, and am particularly interested in
                user experience with different interfaces. Because of this, I have done plenty of work involving web development and design
                to improve readability and maximize user experience.<br>
