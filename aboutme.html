            <div class="bio">I am third-year undergraduate student at Northwestern Universiy studying Neuroscience with 
                a concentration in Human Behavior and Cognition and Computer Science at the Weinberg college of Arts and Sciences. 
                I work as a peer mentor and teaching assistant for an introductory Python course, helping to lead discussion sections and 
                grade homeworks, quizzes and projects. I work in a Neurosciene lab at Northwestern that uses fMRI data to study neural 
                networks and how they affect human behavior. I intend to pursue web development, focusing on human interaction with 
                interfaces after graduating. In addition, I am a senior health educator at Peer Health Exchange, teaching health education
                to freshmen in Chicago Public Schools that do not offer health education courses as part of their curriculum.<br>
