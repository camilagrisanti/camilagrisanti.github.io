                    In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a mock version of an iPod. <br>
                    The file included four files of code: one for the albums page, one for the songs page of the <br> 
                    selected album, one for the individual song that was selected, a CSS styling that all of the HTML <br> 
                    files were linked to, and a JavaScript file where all the features performed in the individual <br>
                    song page were coded.
                </p1>

                    The first picture above shows the home page of the project, where four albums are shown, all with their <br>
                    titles and artists captioned below. The Taylor Swift album "Folklore" is linked to the next HTML file <br>
                    displaying the album's songs. <br>
                    <br>
                    The picture next picture to the left shows the next page of the project, the songs page. Each song is <br>
                    displayed in a numbered list, and the first song is linked to the next page, the iPod page <br>
                    where the user can control many differe features. The page also contains a back button at the top <br>
                    that allows the user to navigate back to the albums page. <br>
                    <br>
                    The last two pictures showcase the actual iPod player once you clikc on the selected song. Using <br>
                    JavaScript, the page includes several different functionalities such as being able to press play and <br>
                    pause on the song, and have the time count up or stop according to that. It also accurately goes to <br>
                    the next or previous song when those buttons are pressed, and indicates the volume correctly if the <br>
                    user decides to press the (+) or (-). Once again, this page also includes a back button that brings the <br>
                    user back to the list of songs if they so please.
