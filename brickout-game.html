                    In this project, I used C++ to code the classic brick out game shown in the video below.

                    The project consisted of over 9 files that worked together using different classes and user interfaces to generate the game. 
                    The code included generating different positions of the ball according to which state the game was in. For instance,
                    during the playing state, the ball would need to bounce up from the paddle and reflect off in order to hit the bricks up top.
                    Once the ball's position reached the bottom of the screen instead of the paddle, its position would need to be updated to
                    the paddle's position to begin again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The bricks were coded using loops and tagged so that each brick that was hit would be successfully deleted from the screen.
                    In addition, the UI file connected the mouse and space bar to the game, where the mouse can move around the paddle to be 
                    aimed at where the ball is going to land, and the space bar can be used to eject the ball initially to begin playing.
